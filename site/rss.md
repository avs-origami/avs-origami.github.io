**[Updates! Fresh Updates! Get yours today!                                 [~/rss]

This site uses RSS feeds to let you subscribe to new blog posts (and possibly
other things at some point). There are two main ways you can utilize this.

**[Email updates
-------------]**

Thanks to a nifty service called feedrabbit, you can sign up to receive updates
via email. Just head on over to this link:

[https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Favs-origami.github.io](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Favs-origami.github.io%2Frss.xml)
[%2Frss.xml](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Favs-origami.github.io%2Frss.xml)

Click the green subscribe button, enter your email, complete the captcha, and
you're on your way. Yipee!

**[The usual RSS way
-----------------]**

If you've never used RSS before, you'll probably find email more convenient. But
if you *want* to learn about it, check out [this page](https://aboutfeeds.com/) for a nice quick-start guide.
Here's a (not very good) TLDR in case you're lazy to read it:

  - Get an RSS reader / newsreader,
  - Copy the feed URL,
  - And stick that in your RSS reader.

Great! Now that you know how RSS works, here's the feed URL:

[https://avs-origami.github.io/rss.xml](/rss.xml)

Paste that in your reader, and you can see when I make a new blog post. Enjoy!
