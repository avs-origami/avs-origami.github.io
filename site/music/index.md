**[My musical ventures.                                                   [~/music]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------]**

I've been learning Carnatic music (South Indian classical music) since I was
four. Over the years, I've refined my skills through learning various songs
(mostly krithis and kirthanams, along with a few raagamalikas, varnams, and
thillanas) in several languages (Kannada, Telegu, Tamil, and Sanskrit).
