Time for an easter egg hunt!

My creations can be found all across this website, from the navigation icons to
some more fun additions.

Some of my more interesting creations on this site include:
  - The Great Penguin Mage (penguin in a wizard hat, my profile picture)
  - Mr. Snail Mail (the snail that lets you email me)
  - The Easter Egg (a literal easter egg with a baby chicken hatching from it)
  - Wise Master Frog (the one who guides you back home if you get lost)
  - The Rock (a very well-dressed pet rock)
  - Tree Garden (surely you passed this on your way here)

Including all icons, there are a total of nine (9) pixel art creations on this
website. Try to find them all!
