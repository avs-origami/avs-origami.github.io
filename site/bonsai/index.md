Bonsai is a hobby that I've been slowly developing in more recent years. It's
not very well established at the moment since trees grow really slowly, but I
have a few works in progress to show off here.

![eastern red cedar](/img/bonsai/oldest.jpg)
*[This is my oldest tree, around 8 or 9 years since I collected it from my
backyard. It's not very green right now because of the weather, but the moss is
surprisingly green at this time of year. There's also a patch of grass in the
pot that came with the tree when I dug it out of the ground, and I've been
maintaining it ever since. The tree isn't very refined though, mostly because
it has sentimental value and so I'm too scared to touch it.

*[I bought this golden mop cypress from Home Depot. This was my first real attempt
at styling, and I think it went quite well. It was also pretty good bonsai
material to begin with, which certainly helped.

show off the nebari but it turned out to just be a really nice picture.

![mugo pine](/img/bonsai/mugo.jpg)
*[This was also a shrub I picked up from a local nursery. I haven't started
styling it yet, since I gave it a pretty heavy root prune right after buying it
and was afraid that styling would kill it. I am planning to begin pruning and
wiring in the spring.
