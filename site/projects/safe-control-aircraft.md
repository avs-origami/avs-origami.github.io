**[Improving Robotic Exploration via RL Graph Pruning             06/2025 - present
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------]**

This work aims to extend an existing approach to safety-guaranteed reinforcement
learning control of multi-agent systems to tasks with more complex control
dynamics. It specifically aims to extend [the DGPPO algorithm developed by Zhang](https://mit-realm.github.io/dgppo/)
[et al](https://mit-realm.github.io/dgppo/) to a custom simulation based on [the F16 control dynamics](https://github.com/MIT-REALM/jax-f16). The goal is to
control a formation of F16s as they follow a pre-designated path with various
safety conditions that must be met at all times during flight.

I am currently pursuing this project under the mentorship of a professor at MIT.
