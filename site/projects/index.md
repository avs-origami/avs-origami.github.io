My current and past major projects.                                 [~/projects]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page is a catalog of all major projects that I have taken up, both current
and past. Most of these are projects that I have either done to present at a
science fair or publish in a journal.


    Current Projects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


        [Improving Robotic Exploration Algorithms Using Reinforcement](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html)
        [Learning Graph Pruning Techniques](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html)

        This project aims to improve existing graph based robotic
        exploration algorithms through the use of a novel RL-based graph
        pruning technique.

        [Tin Can Linux](/projects/tincan.html)

        Recently, I have begun developing and maintaining a custom Linux
        distribution with an emphasis on compactness, understandability,
        and hackability. This talks a bit about why, how I got here, and
        the future direction for the distribution.

    Past Projects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


        [Pion: Custom Arduino Design](/projects/pion.html)

        When I was frustrated with the lack of a small Uno-like Arduino
        that could easily be powered with a small rechargeable LiPo
        battery, I decided to design my own, and this was the result.

        [Frontier-Based Approach Utilizing the RRT Algorithm for](/projects/robot-exploration-rrt.html)
        [Autonomous Exploration of Unknown Environments](/projects/robot-exploration-rrt.html)

        This project aimed to design a frontier-based exploration
        algorithm using RRTs to aid in the path planning process and
        identify regions in the environment requiring further exploration.
