This page is a catalog of major projects that I have taken up, both current and
past. I am still updating this page with more of my past projects.


    **[Current Projects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------]**


    [Improving Robotic Exploration Algorithms Using Reinforcement Learning](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html)
    [Graph Pruning Techniques](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html)

    This project aims to improve existing graph based robotic exploration
    algorithms through the use of a novel RL-based graph pruning technique.

    [Tin Can Linux](/projects/tincan.html)

    I recently began developing and maintaining a custom Linux distribution
    with an emphasis on compactness, understandability, and hackability.
    This talks a bit about why, how I got there, and the future direction
    for the distribution.

    **[Past Projects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------]**


    [Pion: Custom Arduino Design](/projects/pion.html)

    When I was frustrated with the lack of a small Uno-like Arduino that
    could easily be powered with a small rechargeable LiPo battery, I
    decided to design my own, and this was the result.

    [Frontier-Based Approach Utilizing the RRT Algorithm for Autonomous](/projects/robot-exploration-rrt.html)
    [Exploration of Unknown Environments](/projects/robot-exploration-rrt.html)

    This project aimed to design a frontier-based exploration algorithm
    using RRTs to aid in the path planning process and identify regions in
    the environment requiring further exploration.

    **[Mini Projects
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------]**


    [Yeti OS: Bit-Sized Linux Distro for the Raspberry Pi Zero](/wikis/yeti)

    This was one of my experiments in developing a custom Linux distribution
    that eventually led me to create Tin Can Linux.

    [Turtle: Tiny Xorg Window Manager in Rust](/wikis/turtle)

    This was an experiment in creating a custom window manager that I made
    while playing around with Kiss Linux.

    [Ubar: Tiny Status Bar for Xorg](/wikis/ubar)

    I made this 100-ish line C++ program to go along with Turtle.
