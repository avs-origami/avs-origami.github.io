Improving Robotic Exploration via RL Graph Pruning             04/2024 - present
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This work aims to improve the efficiency of graph-based robotic exploration
algorithms by designing a novel reinforcement learning agent to prune the graphs
used for path planning. Specifically, by pruning the path planning graphs, the
goal is to reduce the amount of information needed to effectively plan a path
through the environment that will result in efficient exploration.

I plan to build off [my last project](/projects/robot-exploration-rrt.html), in which I designed an RRT-based robotic
exploration algorithm that enables a simulated robot to explore an unknown
environment through a frontier-based method. I plan to use the algorithm I
developed for that project along with the simulation environment to perform
various experiments validating the performance of the RL agent.

I am currently pursing this project under the mentorship of a professor at the
University of Tennessee Knoxville.
