RRT-Based Robotic Exploration Algorithm                        10/2023 - 04/2024
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aimed to develop an algorithm to enable autonomous robotic
exploration of uncertain environments. It used the properties of RRTs to aid in
the path planning process and identify frontier regions that indicate potential
for information gain.
