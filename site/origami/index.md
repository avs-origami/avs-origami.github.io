**[Transforming a simple piece of paper into art.                       [~/origami]

I picked up origami at a really early age, and since then I've folded hundreds
of models and designed a few of my own. On this page, I've posted some pictures
of the models I'm most proud of.

![hummingbird](/img/origami/hummingbird.jpg)
*[This hummingbird is one of my original designs that I'm quite happy with. This
was one of the rare times that experimenting with random variations of the
traditional origami bases led to something recognizable.

![kangaroo](/img/origami/kangaroo.jpg)
*[Based off ?[this dragon by Jo Nakashima](https://jonakashima.com.br/2015/07/24/origami-dragons), this kangaroo could also be considered
one of my original designs. It even has a pouch (formed from what were
originally the wings on the dragon).

![frog](/img/origami/frog_top.jpg)
![frog](/img/origami/frog_perspective.jpg)
*[This was a really hard model to fold. I spent several hours spread out across
three days, and even had to start over halfway through my first attempt. This is
a design from Robert Lang's Origami Design Secrets. The level of detail in this
model is truly amazing, and I really love how it turned out.

*[The ?[Devil Dragon by Jo Nakashima](https://jonakashima.com.br/2021/02/17/devil-dragon-v3). I regret not starting with a bigger piece of
paper, the eyes were really hard and I ended up accidentally ripping the paper
in a few places including the eye on the other side of the head.

![chameleon](/img/origami/chameleon.jpg)
*[Another ?[Jo Nakashima design](https://jonakashima.com.br/2021/11/10/origami-chameleon). It sits perfectly on the edge of my desk (or in
this case, in a tree, lol).

![lizard](/img/origami/lizard_top.jpg)

*[This was another model from Origami Design Secrets. It's slightly simpler than
the frog, but still really cool nevertheless.]*
