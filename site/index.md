My name is Adithya V. Sastry, and I am a high school student in the Knoxville
area pursuing advanced research opportunities in the fields of robotics and
computer science. My primary area of interest is in applying origami to design
tiny autonomous robots that take inspiration from the adaptations of insects.
Other than that, I am also interested in robotic exploration algorithms, machine
learning, and operating systems (specifically Linux).

My current research involves the use of reinforcement learning to prune dynamic
graphs that are used as part of robotic exploration algorithms, in order to
reduce the amount of information that must be stored and thereby improve the
performance of exploration. [Read more about it here](/projects/robot-graph-pruning.html).

Besides these academic interests, I have been an avid origami enthusiast since a
young age. I've folded hundreds of models and also designed a few of my own.


About this site
===============

This website is primarily meant to be a place to showcase my projects, write
about my interests and hobbies, and collect my various thoughts in one place.

The site itself is built using 'sed' magic to insert plaintext / markdown-ish
documents into an HTML template using <pre> tags to preserve formatting. I
borrowed the idea from the [Kiss Linux website](https://github.com/kisslinux/kisslinux.github.io), and it works quite nicely.
