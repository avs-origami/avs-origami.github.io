Right now, the only way to subscribe is via RSS. If you've never used it before,
check out ?[this page](https://aboutfeeds.com/) for a nice quick-start guide. But if you're too lazy to go
to another website, here's a (not very good) TLDR:
  - Get an RSS reader / newsreader,
  - Copy the feed URL,
  - And stick that in your RSS reader.

Great! Now that you know how RSS works, here's the feed link:

Add that to your reader, and you can see when I make a new blog post. Enjoy!
