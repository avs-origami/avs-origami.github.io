2026 snowstorm?!? Nice!

I guess the weather forecasters forgot to account for the fact that we
(Knoxville and surrounding areas) never actually get snow when it's promised.

*[We were told 10 inches. Guess they must've redefined the inch or something.

Somehow, the snow turned to rain, which caused any snow that had already fallen
to melt. Then it decided to snow again that night.

But, as usual, store shelves were empty, people were panicking, and teachers
were preparing to have the whole week off school.

I had gone to Dick's Sporting Goods the day before to get my tennis racket
re-strung and the guy said that people had suddenly bought out all the portable
butane stoves. Probably because they said we would get ice as well.

But, as usual, nothing came, and the memes have begun circulating again.

Oh well. Time to hope for some better snow before spring rolls around.
