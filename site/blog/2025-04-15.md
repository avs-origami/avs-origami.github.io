I recently bought some new types of origami paper to try, and used them to fold
some insects.

Insects were unfortunately not really the best subjects to test my new paper on,
as it turns out. I used a square of the small tissue foil to fold Robert Lang's
Stag Beetle from Origami Insects and Their Kin, which I would say was the best
result of them all:

The paper was actually a bit thick -- I was expecting tissue foil to be thinner.
But in this case the added heft and the slightly shiny finish made it turn out
really clean and added some extra dimension to the finished model.

I wasn't so lucky with the larger paper though, because I decided I would tackle
the Samurai Helmet Beetle from Origami Insects Vol. 2.

Wrong choice.

I started with the Kraft paper because that was the thinnest, but quickly gave
up because it was WAY too slippery and didn't hold creases. Apparently, it works
best when it's treated with methyl cellulose (MC) to make the paper more stiff.
I didn't know this. Oh well.

I then tried folding it with the large tissue foil, which was a bit thicker but
held the creases much nicer. So far it's gotten pretty thick in many places, so
hopefully it thins out once I start folding out some of the flaps.

Update 12/28/2025: it did not thin out. The final product looks nice from some
angles, but isn't nearly as clean as Lang's rendition. I have no idea how he
folded it so cleanly.

I'll probably have to get some new thinner paper (and some MC) before I try
folding any more insects though.
